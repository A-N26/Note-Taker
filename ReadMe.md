Once that is done, in terminal type `node server.js` or `npm start`, to start the server up which will give the console log of `"server is running on port (number)..."` </br> ![npm start/node server.js](./media/ServerStartCMD.jpg) </br> After that open a new browser window and type `http://localhost:(port number)` in search bar (replace the "(port number)" with the actual number used in server.js file) to start the app locally. or click the mentioned deployed link (Per assignment requirements Heroku was used for deployment).
